### Bog's Rest
We begin at Bog's Rest, an inn off the main road near the high-elven settlement of Duouernum.  The inn is run by Behrenduin Bogsmage (and her kin), an old elven Priestess of Bog and sage who collects tales and written materials brought by travelers from far places.  On this particular night, three unusual travelers arrive.

First: Kwako, a troubled young man who appears to be on the run from some great trauma.  A warlock with a bond to an archfey, he is welcomed by the Followers of Bog.  Still, he remains distant and eager to move on.

Next: A hulking minotaur wearing only the sparest of garb and bearing a mighty axe.  He introduces himself as Koros Ischiros, and after some coaxing, reveals that he was forced to flee his home beneath the mountain where he faces a death sentence for murder - an act which he does not deny, but implies was justified.  Before he can be pressed for details, a third traveler arrives...

Finally: Boughb Dhyllinn, a rolling stone who has stayed at Bog's Rest before, arrives with vestments torn and blood still fresh from great gore wounds.  He claims to have been attacked in the forest outside Rhogarton, a mysterious and newly-build settlement carved out of the deep woods a half-day's journey from Duouernum.  He has suffered some head trauma, and cannot remember the details of the attack.  

Healing is administered by the Bogites, and then talk turns to the mystery of Rhogarton.  Why was the town built?  Who lives there?  And what is behind this mysterious attack that causes townfolk to warn travelers not to travel the woods at night?

Behren has been wanting for some time to travel, and decides to finally leave the inn in the care of her grandchildren.  Koros is intrigued at the prospect of seeing this brave new world, and wishes to lend his axe to solving the mystery.  Kwako wishes only to maintain his flight - but agrees that traveling as a party seems wise under the circumstances.  Boughb Dhyllinn naturally declines to return to the source of his injuries, preferring to depart in the opposite direction.

### Rhogarton 
The next day the three journey to Rhogarton.  They find the settlement with a rough-hewn palisade wall and a variety of newly-built buildings.  Lord Rhogar, the town's founder, is absent.  Kwako finds several magical glowing symbols etched into the walls.  Discovering a tailor, Koros is enchanted by the prospect of replacing his barbaric garb with a woven-wool one-piece jumpsuit cut fashionably to accentuate his impressive physique.  Behrenduin discovers a notice left by recent travelers warning that the wild boar in the woods are acting erratically at night.

The party proposes to construct a fine defensive/observation platform for the town in order to observe the boar at night, a wise prospect offering manifold defensive advantages for the town's future (as well as aesthetic appeal - who doesn't love a good platform?).  Their proposal is summarily rejected by the townspeople, who state that they do not mind the boars, and find the prospect of further tree-felling distasteful.  

The party then asks whether the boar should be left alone, but the town communally implies that it would probably be nice if the woods were safer at night after all, if only someone would take the initiative.  The party then asks if the town has made any effort whatsoever to deal with the boar themselves, but it becomes clear that the good citizenry of Rhogarton are either industriously performing their daily tasks (that do not include tree-felling for future farms, hunting boar, securing the vital trade route into town, or otherwise performing tasks not explicitly detailed by Lord Rhogar), or they are wasted at noon in the pub due to the stress of their boar problem.  

After a refreshing pub lunch, the party wanders into the woods where they find a picturesque family of boar, peacefully browsing the lush undergrowth.  They lure the boar close with a series of well-placed illusions, send them into a peaceful sleep, and then mercilessly slaughter all but one, which they hog-tie and parade into town.

There they are confronted by a distraught tot - a wee girl named Shelby who turns out to be a fledgling sorcerer.  Little Shelby, it emerges, has been struggling to control her newfound magic and has been enchanting the boar (as well as crafting magical graffiti).  After delivering a brief safety lecture, Behren promises to help the girl practice magic without mauling unsuspecting travelers (or otherwise doing things that could get you tried as a witch).

### Mysteries to be uncovered
- Who is Lord Rhogar and why is he so handsome?
- What are his ambitions and can we assist?
- Why is Kwako running?
- What's Koros' deal?
- How do the good people of Rhogarton eat?
- What kind of foot traffic does the potion shop receive, or does it primarily serve as a regional supplier?  Will caravans of potions and potion supplies need regular escorts?
- Ditto for the tailor and blacksmith...  Perhaps Lord Rhogar in his infinite wisdom and foresight is creating a center of commerce and industry, relying on trade to provide staples while reaping profits from specialization in designer garments, potions, and high-end armor- and weapon-smithing.
- Will Koros' suit be in an understated dark blue, or will Beth Tailor know that his initial instinct towards a red jumpsuit will make him the hippest disco barbarian the land has ever seen?

## Session 1

### Pig roast
Having dispatched a fair number of boar, the party brings them into town and assists in preparing a pig roast for the people of Rhogarton.  The effusive townfolk embrace the proposal, rolling out barrels of beer and mead and striking up festive dancing.  The town also thanks each boar-killer with five golden dubloons adorned with Lord Rhogar's chiseled profile and emblazoned with his crest.  During the festivities, the party converses and gathers information:

- Koros drinks very quickly and becomes exceedingly drunk, eventually pouring out the story of how he came to murder a fellow minotaur: "He filled my family!"  But lacking the necessary evidence to present before the rigid law-courts of Minotaur society, Koros was forced to exact vengeance himself and then flee.  He also admits, while deep within his cups, that he doubts the existence of the multitudinous and actively-meddling deities, preferring to attribute their actions to the vague stochasticisms of Fate.  

- Behrenduin and Kwako talk to various townspeople as well as to Amberlee the book seller, and learn that many of the townfolk here have had their lives saved by the heroic actions of Lord Rhogar.  Kwako learns that Shelby, the young sorcerer, is very special to Lord Rhogar, and is considered a darling of the town at large.  Behren also gives Amberlee a list of scrolls that she desires for a spellbook which she is currently in the process of creating.

- Behrenduin apologizes to Tabitha Innskeep for getting off on the wrong foot.  In elven hospitality culture, it is considered rude to ask a guest to sit in a particular place upon entering (elves are more chaotic and free-wheeling than humans).  Behren is adjusting to the strange customs of human innkeepers.

### An emmissary
After the festivities conclude, the three spend the night in the inn.  In the morning an emissary from Lord Rhogar greets them, and explains that his excellency has divine abilities to monitor and protect the town.  With Shelby's help, he had engineered the boar situation in order to attract a certain caliber of person to aid the budding town in its various pursuits.

Two missions of note are mentioned: 
- To aid Vorgrim, the maker of potions, trinkets, and oddities.
- To aid an important trading partner in a nearby settlement.

Choosing the nearest mission, the group talks to Vorgrim, a deep gnome.  It transpires that beneath his shop is a series of natural caverns.  Not only have the caverns proved to be full of rare and useful minerals for his craft, but they also offer an opportunity for cool and dark storage.  Thus Vorgrim and several of his kin have been excavating the natural caves, expanding them into a simple cellar.  However they delved too greedily and too deep, and they awoke in the darkness that which caused them to flee - Vorgrim's bane.

Kwako, desiring a weapon other than a dagger for the ensuing clash, uses his Fey Presence to charm a guard (Terrence Brosefson) into lending him his embossed short-sword.  

### To the batcave
Girding themselves for battle, the three stalwart steadies enter the cramped backroom of Vorgrim's Vitals where they find the entrance to a gnome-sized passage which descends into the chilly darkness below.  Crouching low, the trio proceeds.

With a light spell cast upon a brass brazier of Behren's, the three pierce the inky veil, eventually encountering several large and dangerous-looking bats sleeping in an alcove.  The bats are not disturbed by the distant light, and so Behren is able to cast Sleep, dropping one into magical unconsciousness.  The second they battle, felling with ease.

A brief search of the area results in both Kwako and Koros inexplicably blinding themselves.  

At that moment more bats emerge from their hiding places on the wall; but with similar doses of Sleep and steel, alongside Kwako's artfully placed minor illusion, the foes are felled despite the severe disadvantages imposed by the cramped dimensions of the passage and the decidedly strange fit of dual blindness.

Having finally regathered their collective ocular accuity, the party advances into a large natural chamber with a higher ceiling. Here they encounter a fearsome bat of even larger proportions.  Kwako hexes the fell beast, and in a rain of blows the trio cuts it down, with Koros finally cleaving the screaching menace in twain.

Taking their time, the party then thoroughly combs the cavern, turning up several uncut precious stones.  They gather their spent missiles (using Mending to repair any that were damaged) and prepare to return to the surface.

### Mysteries to be uncovered
- Is there another entrance to the caverns?  Or were the bats essentially in a dormant state while the potion shop was constructed and the tunnels excavated?  If the caverns have a second entrance, this could compromise the security not only of the store, but of the town at large.  On the other hand, it could provide a secret passage in case of a seige, if properly hidden, trapped, and defended.  
- Why is Kwako running?  In a surprise move, he has stuck around and helped "delve the batcave" as the young folk call it.  Perhaps the daily doses of murderous violence satisfy some inward desire - or at the very least stave off the advance of existential ennui?  Or does the prospect of Rhogarton's powerful divinely-backed safety afford a measure of security unheard of until this point?  Surely it cannot be that the chaotic company of an eccentric elven crone and a barely-house-trained ox-man could tempt the troubled youth to stay his flight?
- What is this mission with the trader and how much will it pay?
- What compensation will the party receive for recently risking life and limb beneath the foundations of Rhogarton?

### Level up
The party is now second level.  They are each now more capable than the average town guard in a small town.
