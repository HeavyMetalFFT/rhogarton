### Bog's Rest

We begin at Bog's Rest, an inn off the main road near the high-elven settlement of Duouernum.  The inn is run by Behrenduin Bogsmage (and her kin), an old elven Priestess of Bog and sage who collects tales and written materials brought by travelers from far places.  On this particular night, three unusual travelers arrive.

First: Kwako, a troubled young man who appears to be on the run from some great trauma.  A warlock with a bond to an archfey, he is welcomed by the Followers of Bog.  Still, he remains distant and eager to move on.

Next: A hulking minotaur wearing only the sparest of garb and bearing a mighty axe.  He introduces himself as Koros Ischiros, and after some coaxing, reveals that he was forced to flee his home beneath the mountain where he faces a death sentence for murder - an act which he does not deny, but implies was justified.  Before he can be pressed for details, a third traveler arrives...

Finally: Boughb Dhyllinn, a rolling stone who has stayed at Bog's Rest before, arrives with vestments torn and blood still fresh from great gore wounds.  He claims to have been attacked in the forest outside Rhogarton, a mysterious and newly-build settlement carved out of the deep woods a half-day's journey from Duouernum.  He has suffered some head trauma, and cannot remember the details of the attack.  

Healing is administered by the Bogites, and then talk turns to the mystery of Rhogarton.  Why was the town built?  Who lives there?  And what is behind this mysterious attack that causes townfolk to warn travelers not to travel the woods at night?

Behren has been wanting for some time to travel, and decides to finally leave the inn in the care of her grandchildren.  Koros is intrigued at the prospect of seeing this brave new world, and wishes to lend his axe to solving the mystery.  Kwako wishes only to maintain his flight - but agrees that traveling as a party seems wise under the circumstances.  Boughb Dhyllinn naturally declines to return to the source of his injuries, preferring to depart in the opposite direction.

### Rhogarton 

The next day the three journey to Rhogarton.  They find the settlement with a rough-hewn palisade wall and a variety of newly-built buildings.  Lord Rhogar, the town's founder, is absent.  Kwako finds several magical glowing symbols etched into the walls.  Discovering a tailor, Koros is enchanted by the prospect of replacing his barbaric garb with a woven-wool one-piece jumpsuit cut fashionably to accentuate his impressive physique.  Behrenduin discovers a notice left by recent travelers warning that the wild boar in the woods are acting erratically at night.

The party proposes to construct a fine defensive/observation platform for the town in order to observe the boar at night, a wise prospect offering manifold defensive advantages for the town's future (as well as aesthetic appeal - who doesn't love a good platform?).  Their proposal is summarily rejected by the townspeople, who state that they do not mind the boars, and find the prospect of further tree-felling distasteful.  

The party then asks whether the boar should be left alone, but the town communally implies that it would probably be nice if the woods were safer at night after all, if only someone would take the initiative.  The party then asks if the town has made any effort whatsoever to deal with the boar themselves, but it becomes clear that the good citizenry of Rhogarton are either industriously performing their daily tasks (that do not include tree-felling for future farms, hunting boar, securing the vital trade route into town, or otherwise performing tasks not explicitly detailed by Lord Rhogar), or they are wasted at noon in the pub due to the stress of their boar problem.  

After a refreshing pub lunch, the party wanders into the woods where they find a picturesque family of boar, peacefully browsing the lush undergrowth.  They lure the boar close with a series of well-placed illusions, send them into a peaceful sleep, and then mercilessly slaughter all but one, which they hog-tie and parade into town.

There they are confronted by a distraught tot - a wee girl named Shelby who turns out to be a fledgling sorcerer.  Little Shelby, it emerges, has been struggling to control her newfound magic and has been enchanting the boar (as well as crafting magical graffiti).  After delivering a brief safety lecture, Behren promises to help the girl practice magic without mauling unsuspecting travelers (or otherwise doing things that could get you tried as a witch).

### Mysteries to be uncovered
- Who is Lord Rhogar and why is he so handsome?
- What are his ambitions and can we assist?
- Why is Kwako running?
- What's Koros' deal?
- How do the good people of Rhogarton eat?
- What kind of foot traffic does the potion shop receive, or does it primarily serve as a regional supplier?  Will caravans of potions and potion supplies need regular escorts?
- Ditto for the tailor and blacksmith...  Perhaps Lord Rhogar in his infinite wisdom and foresight is creating a center of commerce and industry, relying on trade to provide staples while reaping profits from specialization in designer garments, potions, and high-end armor- and weapon-smithing.
- Will Koros' suit be in an understated dark blue, or will Beth Tailor know that his initial instinct towards a red jumpsuit will make him the hippest disco barbarian the land has ever seen?
